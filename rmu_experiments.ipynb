      "Mitochondria are organelles found in eukaryotic cells that are responsible for producing ATP, the primary energy currency of cells. They are often referred to as the \"powerhouse\" of the cell because of their critical role in energy production. Mitochondria are unique in that they have their own DNA, which is inherited maternally in most eukaryotes. This DNA is distinct from the nuclear DNA and is thought to have originated from an ancient bacterial endosymbiont that was engulfed by a primitive eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria are also involved in other cellular processes, such as calcium homeostasis, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and the regulation of cellular metabolism.</s>\n"
